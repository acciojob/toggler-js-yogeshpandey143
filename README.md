# Toggler

### Create a webpage that provides user with a toggler to choose the project requirement. The webpage should include the following elements:

- A heading (h2) with the content "How do you want your project to be"
- Three input checkboxes under the div with class `toggle-container`. All the divs should have class as 'g1', 'g2', 'g3'.
- Each checkbox should have ids as `good`, `cheap`, `fast` and a common class `toggle`.
- There should be a span within the div of each toggler with content as `good`, `cheap`, `fast` respectively.
- When the user click on any of the checkbox then the checkbox should change it's color.
- At a time at max only two checkboxes can be clicked.
- Suppose a user has already clicked on two checkboxes and now if he click on any other checkbox then one of the previous check box become unclicked.


The webpage should look like this:

Now in the above image if we click on fast button then one of the checkboxes from good and cheap gets uncliked.
